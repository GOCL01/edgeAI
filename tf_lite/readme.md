<h1> TensorfloLite </h1>
TensorFlow Lite uses TensorFlow models converted into a smaller, more efficient machine learning (ML) model format. You can use pre-trained models with TensorFlow Lite, modify existing models, or build your own TensorFlow models and then convert them to TensorFlow Lite format. TensorFlow Lite models can perform almost any task a regular TensorFlow model can do: object detection, natural language processing, pattern recognition, and more using a wide range of input data including images, video, audio, and text.

Post Training quantization
https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization#:~:text=Post%2Dtraining%20quantization%20is%20a,little%20degradation%20in%20model%20accuracy.

The current repo contains toy examples on LeNet300 and LeNet5 aiming to perform Post-Training Quantization based on tensorflowLite.
